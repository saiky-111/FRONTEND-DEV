It is told that,our main file should be named index.html
>Why?
-> Index.html is a special file , such that even if we don't write
anything after the slash, then also it will serve.

http://127.0.0.1:5500/01_WHY_USE_INDEX.HTML/
-> Both these will give same output

->But it is not the case with about.html or any other file name.html

-> Any browser by default, serves the index.html file in the main or 
root directory

https://frontend-roadmap-saiky-111.netlify.app/index.html
-> Both these above links gives same output, because netlify servers 
by default without telling the index.html, serving in the home page

-> Any name other than index.html will not get served 


->We should keep it index.html so that if we deploy it on some server, 
by default it gets the index.html file and serves it on the home page 
automatically.
->If any other name is given, error will come, like Page Not found

-> Netlify may serve if we keep our main file name as home.html file
