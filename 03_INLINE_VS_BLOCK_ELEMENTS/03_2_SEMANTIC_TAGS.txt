-> Semantic Means Meaning

//Defination ->A Semantic element clearly defines it's meaning to
both the browser and the developer.

-> In HTML, Certain tags like semantic tags , which works just like div, 
which are used to categorize and combine elements into sections.

->Semantic tags are just like div, there are no extra functionality.

-> Examples of Semantic HTML Tags are : Nav tags, Header tag, 
Main Tag, Section Tag, Footer Tag, 

-> Google Search Engine comes for searching our website, 
Google Search Engine will become confuse , if we use div
 everywhere, i.e why we use semantic tags like header ,footer,
  so that the engine can understand which is what.

-> as a developer also, the code becomes readable, when semantic tags are sued.

  -> Links are kept under nav tags, since it is related to navigation.
  They are just like div, just that it carries a meaning that 
  there are some navigation links inside it.

  -> If we want , we can keep anything inside these semantic tags, 
  just the search engine would get confuse.

  ->In the Bottom part of the website , footer tag is used.

  -> In  the main tag, we keep the entire content of the website, 
  except the header.

  -> Section tag is used to show a section of the website, just like div.

  -> Ideally we can add anything in anywhere, but it's not a good practice.

  -> 2 useful semantic Inline tags:
     <em> tag i.e emphasis tag is used to give more power to a word. 
     It just makes the text slant just like italic.

  ->since, <i> tag doesn't carry any meaning, it's just a stylistic choice.

   ->But when <em> tag is used, and a screen reader is reading the line,
    it will read with a emphasis given on the word, i.e it will prononunce
     the word differentely.

  -> <strong> tag i.e strong tag is used to give more power to a word. 
     It just makes the text bold just like b tag , i.e, bold tag.
     -> It defines a importtant text in the document.
