  <body style="font-family: sans-serif"> --->Here we have given style attribute to  body.
-----> style="font-family: sans-serif"  -> this is the style attribute above.
  ---> Attributes are always kept in the opening tags of any element.

  <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"
        target="_blank"
        >graphical user interface</a
      >
---> Here in the Anchor tag href and target are the attributes.

----> In Img tag, alt attribute is there, src attribute is there.

----> But, if we give src attribute in <p> tag , the browser 
will ignore it, since it doesn't know what to do with it.

---> So, some attributes are there which are made for a particular
 element only like alt attribute and src attribute, which
  can be given in img tag only.

  -->Some attributes are there which can be given in any element, are called Global attributes.

---> Defination: Global attributes are attributes that can be used with all HTML elements.
EX: Style attribute is a global attribute. It can be given to any element and it will work.

----> Another global attribute is hidden.
Ex: <h1 hidden>Frontend Development</h1>  ---> If we do this, 
Frontend Development will not show.

---> In Hidden attribute, we dont require to give any values, like Style attribute.

---> Another global attribute we can give is Title attribute

    <img
      src="/images/html-css-javascript.png"
      alt="html-css-javascript"
      style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
    />
