<!DOCTYPE html>
--> HTML Doctype tells which version of HTML are we using. HTML5, currently using.
--> If we write html after DOCTYPE, browser gets informed that it's HTML version 5.

HTML4: We used to write like this:
 <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">

<html lang="en">
.....
</html>
 --> Our whole code lies inside the HTML tag, be it head or body tag
 --> It represents a document (page) of HTML.
--> it is the biggest tag.

--> Inside body tag, if e write anything, it shows on the screen of the browser.

--> Inside head tag, we can only see title and favicon.ico icon. 
Other than these , we can't see anything.
