Ex :
<h1>Frontend Development</h1>

-> in this line, <h1> is a opening tag
</h1> is a closing tag.
----> There are some tags , which are self closing tags.

---> when  we fill  any content inside the tags, 
it is collectively known as HTML element.
---> Tag is just a representation which we keep in angular brackets.

--> The things which come to us created from browser, is called an element.

<h1>Frontend Development</h1>   ------> This is collectively known as HTML element.

----> Height and Width that we talk about is of an element, and not of a tag.
-----> Element has it's height and width.

-----> Tag has no height and width.

-> Tag is just there to represent the element.
