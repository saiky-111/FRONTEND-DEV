  <body style="font-family: sans-serif"> --->Here we have given style attribute to  body.
-----> style="font-family: sans-serif"  -> this is the style attribute above.
----> We write the attribute, then in double quotes , we give some values to it.
  ---> Attributes are always kept in the opening tags of any element.

-----------------------------------------------------------

  <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"
        target="_blank"
        >graphical user interface</a
      >
---> Here in the Anchor tag href and target are the attributes.

----> In Img tag, alt attribute is there, src attribute is there.

----> But, if we give src attribute in <p> tag , the browser 
will ignore it, since it doesn't know what to do with it.

---> So, some attributes are there which are made for a particular
 element only like alt attribute and src attribute, which
  can be given in img tag only. -> href is for anchor tag.

  -->Some attributes are there which can be given in any element, are called Global attributes.

---> Defination: Global attributes are attributes that can be used with all HTML elements.
EX: Style attribute is a global attribute. It can be given to any element and it will work.

----> Another global attribute is hidden.
Ex: <h1 hidden>Frontend Development</h1>  ---> If we do this, 
Frontend Development will not show.

----->     <img
      src="/images/html-css-javascript.png"
      alt="html-css-javascript"
      style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
      hidden
    />
----> Now the above image is hidden.

--->Some attributes are there, where we dones't require to give any values to it. 
e.g. hidden attribute

---> In Hidden attribute, we dont require to give any values.

---> In Style attribute, we are required to give some values.

---> Another global attribute we can give is Title attribute, which takes some value.

    <img
      src="/images/html-css-javascript.png"
      alt="html-css-javascript"
      style="width: 100%; max-width: 600px"
      title="Frontend Roadmap"
    />

  --> So, after writing the title attribute, if we hover our cursor over 
  the element where title attribute is given, it will show a text , of
  the value given to title attribute.
  ---> see note4.png

  ---> And the order of the attributes doesn't matter, whether href 
  attribute is ahead or target attribute is ahead, in a an anchor(<a>)tag.

 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface"
    target="_blank" title="graphical user interface">graphical user interface</a>

    -> when cursor is hovered over the link text of graphical user interface,
    a text wil be shown of graphical user interface.

-> It is called a Tool Tip, the text which is shown , when cursor is hovered over something.

--> Some attributes are there which when used doesn't show it's effect directly.
--> Examples are: class and id attributes.

-> eg: <h1 class= "heading" >Frontend Development</h1>

->In the value of class or id, any text or string is allowed to give.
-> Class attribute is mostly used in CSS, by using which some changes are seen.
-> eg: <h1 class= "heading" id="heading" >Frontend Development</h1>

-> we'll used id attribue in CSS as well as JAVASCRIPT.

--> Another attribute is data attribute, which is mainly used in Javascript.
-> Data hyphen then any value then equalto then any value.

--->   data-=""  used to store custom data private to a page or application

-> eg: <h1 class= "heading" id="heading" data-title="jebhf" >Frontend Development</h1>

----------------------------------------------------------------------
CUSTOM ATTRIBUTES

Custom attributes are anything you write, abcdefgh, anything will be a attribute in HTML.
-> We know it does not exist in the specification of HTML, but is stiil attribueribute, and then we can
 use it in CSS and JAVASCRIPT

Ex: <h1 abcdefgh >Frontend Development</h1>  
-> we can also give some value to it and use it in  CSS and JAVASCRIPT
-> But these custom attributes are generally not used.

Ex: <h1 saikat="dhibar" >Frontend Development</h1> 
 --->The above saikat="dhibar", It will be valid attribute in pov of CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
 --> But it does not exist in the specification of HTML.
