<form id="search-form" action="/results" class="style-scope ytd-searchbox">


<input id="search" autocapitalize="none" autocomplete="off" 
autocorrect="off" name="search_query" tabindex="0" type="text" 
spellcheck="false" placeholder="Search" aria-label="Search" role="combobox"
 aria-haspopup="false" aria-autocomplete="list" dir="ltr" 
 style="outline: none;" class="ytd-searchbox"> 

--> Input is always inside the Form tag.

Since, action="/results" is there in the form element, therefore the URL redirects to 
https://www.youtube.com/results

Since,  name="search_query" is there in the input element, therefore the URL redirects to 
https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=

After this, the input we entered gets added: with, if there is a space it automatically
 adds a '+' sign in between.

--> See NOTE_1.png

So, the form tag creates URL by the values of action and the name attribute and the input we entered
, it creates an URL , and then it redirects to the same URL.

--> for different websites it is diferent , like:
After action value it puts a question mark  by itself. THen the value of name attribute is added
,then '=' sign then the input we entered.

<form class="Hy6F9O header-form-search" action="/search" method="GET">

<input class="zDPmFV" type="text" 
title="Search for products, brands and more" name="q" autocomplete="off"
 placeholder="Search for products, brands and more" value="phone">

-> value attribute in input tag , shows the value we searched
-> The things written in the link after that , is something used by flipkart for tracking
Even if we remove that part , it will give the same result.

 --> See NOTE_2.png

 ->Form tag creates the URL dynamically.
 -> In anchor tag, we hard code the URL.
