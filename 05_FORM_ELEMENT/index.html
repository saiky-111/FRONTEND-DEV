   <form action="/"><!-- By putting slash(/) here, it will point to our own website
    or our own server, i.e we will think our website is only getting reloaded-->
    <!--Inside form element . we put input element.-->
    <input type="text" name="search">
    <!--Type is a attribute in input tag. Even if we don't type type="text",
    it will automatically detect it as text,by default .-->
    <!--But we should mention it, as it's a good practice.-->
    <!--Input is a self closing tag-->
    <!--When we only give slash(/) , it points to the main URL of the website,
    e.g. 127.0.0.1:5500/  it becomes-> http://127.0.0.1:5500/?search=hi  (when we searched hi)
    it doesn't include any file.(now here it won't point to index.html)-->
   </form>

    <form action="/">
        <!--If we remove input field from form element, but keep the form element,
    (as we can see it's dimentions are (932*0)
    in web page we won't see it, but , if we inspect it's height is zero at the moment,
    since there is no content inside. By default, form element is empty.
    Also, form element is a block level element, it will cover the whole width of the screen.-->

    </form>

<p>Useless Search Box:</p>
    <div action="https://github.com/saiky-111">
        <input type="text" name="search">
    <!--Apparently, form element is just like div, but it adds functionality.
    i.e if we change the form element to div, the input box will display as it is.
    But, when we type inside it and enter, nothing will happen.
    So, the functionality of the form element is to create the URL-->
</div>


<p>Youtube Search Box:</p>
<form action="https://www.youtube.com/results">

         <button>Submit</button>
        <!--https://www.amazon.in/s?k=mobile&b=goat&c=hen--> <!--
        If this is searched, amazon only recognizes k ,and shows the result based on k
        and ignores the other two.
