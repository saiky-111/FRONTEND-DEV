     What we can do is: We can put the label in a <p> tag, but that
        will take too much of the space. So we will use <div> instead. Since div is a block element.
            In <div> , there will be no gap.It will come just above the input field. -->

    it doesn't include any file.(now here it won't point to index.html)-->

    in web page we won't see it, but , if we inspect it's height is zero at the moment,
    since there is no content inside. By default, form element is empty.
    Also, form element is a block level element, it will cover the whole width of the screen.-->

    i.e if we change the form element to div, the input box will display as it is.
    But, when we type inside it and enter, nothing will happen.
    So, the functionality of the form element is to create the URL-->
