//CSS IS AWESOME -meme
//If there is the big box, but our text goes outside.
//That's our mistake,i.e whoever has given the width of the box.
//But the beauty of CSS is that the text which was going outside the box,
now also it is showing, i.e CSS hasn't cut the text.

-> CSS- Cascading Style Sheet

//Installing One Dark Pro for colourful code snippets, i.e it colourifies the code

//Installing Material Icon Theme-> actual icons for different files

-> Style sheet means list or sheet of styles. We want our webpage to give colour,
 position of some text , text colour, different fonts etc.

->Our webpage is mainly made up of HTML. We add CSS additionaly to it to give style,
we add Javascript to give functionality.


-> We can write our CSS in HTML in Three ways:

1-> Inline CSS-> which we give inside a HTML tag.
-> Inside every HTML element, there is style attruibute., there we can write CSS.
--> We can also say this, element sty;e. i.e it is only applied on that element
-> style given only on that element is called inline CSS.
-> Color -> property changes the Color of the text.

-> There is a principle in Coding i.e DRY-> Don't Repeat Yourself
-> i.e don't repeat the code, again and again.
-> The code you are writing once, should work all the time.(for all similar elements.)

-> For this, we write a style tag inside the head tag.
